# Kent Beck TDD Python
## Following the examples of TDD outlined in Kent Beck's book Test Driven Development

Kent Beck is the author of Test-Driven Development. A book outlining a style of development consisting of techniques which encourages simple design and inspires confidence. The ultimate goal of TDD is to release working software quickly and give developers peace of mind when making changes.

Due to its nature, TDD is extremely useful in an agile environment. You'll see how relying on these techniques, along with simple DevOps practices, software development can proceed smoothly.

## Mindset
Given some project, or some requirements. Ask yourself, "What set of tests, when passed, will demonstrate the presense of code we are confident will compute the desired output correctly?"

To answer these questions make a To-do list as a reminder of your goals

## Rules
